### Welcome to the portfolio website of Kelson Adams

Welcome to my portfolio website! After graduating from John Cabot University in 
Rome, Italy with degrees in International Affairs and International Business, 
I soon started getting into programming.

Currently, I am a junior web developer attending Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco. 
While I am only on the first week of DBC, I have followed several Udemy online bootcamps 
for Ruby on Rails programming.
