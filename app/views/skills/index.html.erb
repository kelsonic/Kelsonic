            My name is Kelson. I am a full stack web developer living in San Francisco. I have lived more 
            than 20% of my life in foreign countries and have visited 20+ nations. 
            Apart from programming languages, I speak English, Dutch, Spanish, 
            and Italian.

            I was born and raised in Colorado. In high school, when I wasn't skiing 
            the slopes of Vail or Winter Park, I was either studying for my 7 AP 
            classes or working 35+ hours per week at a local hospital.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            While I loved the nature in Colorado, I deeply wanted to explore 
            and learn about the various perspectives in the world - an education 
            that would require learning outside a classroom.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            I applied only to one university (an American university in Rome, Italy) 
            and was accepted. So I packed my bags and got ready to leave for the 
            other side of the planet.

            I moved to Italy right after high school where I attended an American 
            university in Rome. While I traveled all around Italy and 10+ other 
            countries in Europe during my 4 years at the university, my studies 
            were rigorous as I took enough courses to obtain both a Bachelor's of 
            Arts in International Affairs and International Business.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            While in Italy, I taught myself Italian when socializing with friends 
            there. I also met my Dutch wife in the process, so I decided to learn 
            Dutch as well.

            When I wasn't studying, I created How2Bee.com with my friend from Kenya. 
            Despite the website getting over 12,000 visitors in less than 3 weeks, 
            WordPress proved very frustrating to customize, which pushed me to learn 
            how to program.

            After I graduated from the American university in Rome, my wife and I 
            moved to the Netherlands. There I worked as the Marketing Manager of a 
            tech startup that teaches kids how to code.

            As we waited for my wife's US Visa, I became interested in programming. 
            At one point, my wife and I both started a Ruby on Rails online bootcamp - 
            and we were immediately hooked.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            In less than 1.5 months, we created 8 Rails projects and 4 Unity video games. 
            We fell in love with coding. So I decided to refine my skills at Dev Bootcamp 
            in San Francisco.

            While studying at Dev Bootcamp, there wasn't more than 10 hours that went by 
            (including the weekends) that I wasn't coding. I pushed myself to build at least 
            one project per week, and it paid off.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            At the end of the bootcamp, I had built over 20+ projects, most of which use different 
            technologies that I had to learn in only a couple of days.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            For the final project, I was the team lead to build a 
            <a href="http://minidriver.herokuapp.com" class="text-lighten-2 orange-text"> self-driving RC car</a> 
            using recurrent neural networks, Raspberry Pis, Python, and many machine learning libraries.
