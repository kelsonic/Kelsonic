            My name is Kelson. I am from the United States, but I have lived more 
            than 20% of my life in foreign countries and have visited 20+ nations. 
            Apart from programming languages, I speak English, Dutch, Spanish, 
            and Italian.

            I was born and raised in Colorado. In high school, when I wasn't skiing 
            the slopes of Vail or Winter Park, I was either studying for my 7 AP 
            classes or working 20+ hours per week at a local hospital.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            While I loved the nature in Colorado, I deeply wanted to explore 
            and learn about the various perspectives in the world - an education 
            that would require learning outside a classroom.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            I applied only to one university (an American university in Rome, Italy) 
            and was accepted. So I packed my bags and got ready to leave for the 
            other side of the planet where I knew no one.

            I moved to Italy right after high school where I attended an American 
            university in Rome. While I traveled all around Italy and 10+ other 
            countries in Europe during my 4 years at the university, my studies 
            were rigorous as I took enough courses to obtain both a Bachelor's of 
            Arts in International Affairs and International Business.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            While in Italy, I taught myself Italian when socializing with friends 
            there. I also met my Dutch wife in the process, so I decided to start 
            learning Dutch as well.

            When I wasn't studying, I created How2Bee.com with my friend from Kenya. 
            Despite the website getting over 12,000 visitors in less than 3 weeks, 
            WordPress proved very frustrating at times to customize, which pushed 
            me later on to learn programming languages.

            After I graduated from the American university in Rome, my wife and I 
            moved to the Netherlands where we waited together for her green card so 
            we could move to San Francisco.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            As we waited for her Visa, I became interested in programming. I took 
            several courses in Python and even a course in MatLab. At one point, 
            my wife and I both started taking a Ruby on Rails online bootcamp - 
            and we were immediately hooked.
          </p>
          <p class="white-text">
            In less than 1.5 months we created 8 Rails projects. We loved it. So 
            I decided to enroll for Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco.
