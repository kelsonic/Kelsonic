            My name is Kelson. I am from the United States, but I have lived more 
            than 20% of my life in foreign countries and have visited 20+ nations. 
            Apart from programming languages, I speak English, Dutch, Spanish, 
            and Italian.

            I moved to Italy right after high school where I attended an American 
            university in Rome. While I traveled all around Italy and 10+ other 
            countries in Europe during my 4 years at the university, my studies 
            were rigorous as I took enough courses to obtain both a Bachelor's of 
            Arts in International Affairs and International Business.

            While in university, I created How2Bee.com with my friend from Kenya. 
            Despite the website getting over 12,000 visitors in less than 3 weeks, 
            WordPress (the CMS the website uses) proved very difficult to customize.
